# Lesson 2 Prep Material

This material is **optional** and is meant to supplement the [reading material](prepare.md) for this lesson. If you find that you are having a hard time grasping concepts from this lesson it may be worth reviewing the material below:

**[threaded_class_demo.py](../prep/threaded_class_demo.py/)**

Review, reverse engineer, and run the `threaded_class_demo.py` to get some hands on practice with threaded classes in Python. It will be helpful to compare this demo to the `thread_demo.py` from the previous lessons prep material.

**[thread_lock_demo.py](../prep/thread_lock_demo.py/)**

Run the `thread_lock_demo.py` to see a visualization of what thread locking is doing.
