# Lesson 3 Prep Material

This material is **optional** and is meant to supplement the [reading material](prepare.md) for this lesson. If you find that you are having a hard time grasping concepts from this lesson it may be worth reviewing the material below:

**[pool_demo.py](../prep/pool_demo.py)**

Review, reverse engineer, and run the `pool_demo.py` to get some hands on practice with multithreading and Pools in Python.

**[process_1_demo.py](../prep/process_1_demo.py/)**

Review, reverse engineer, and run the `process_1_demo.py` to get some hands on practice with multithreading and Processes in Python.

**[process_2_demo.py](../prep/process_2_demo.py/)**

Run the `process_2_demo.py` and compare its output with the output from the `process_1_demo.py` demo. It may be helpful to go back an review Threads to compare them to multithreaded Processes.
