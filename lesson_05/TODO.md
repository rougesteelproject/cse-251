Polling is missing from this week! -> That is where the Manager demo should be if I remember correctly.

Better explain why the Prove requires (uses) a Barrier.

Why does the prove Queue251 remove `size()` is this to encourage not relying on the queue size?
NOTE: It was only needed last week to track the dealership stats, since we don't do that now its not needed.

Add a note that [this table](https://github.com/byui-keers/cse-251/blob/main/lesson_05/canvas/prepare.md#managers) is for 3.9 only, a bug that was introduced (?) was fixed/removed and this will now work.
