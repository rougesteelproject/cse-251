INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A young man, ALEX, is sitting at a table, reading a book. He is wearing a button-down shirt and glasses. A young woman, BECKY, enters the coffee shop and walks over to the counter. She orders a coffee and then looks around for a place to sit. She sees Alex and smiles. She walks over to his table.

BECKY: Hi. Mind if I join you?

ALEX: Not at all. Please, sit down.

Becky sits down across from Alex.

BECKY: I'm Becky.

ALEX: I'm Alex.

BECKY: Nice to meet you, Alex.

ALEX: Nice to meet you too, Becky.

Becky and Alex smile at each other. There is an awkward silence for a moment.

BECKY: So, what are you reading?

ALEX: It's a book about the history of coffee.

BECKY: Really? That's interesting.

ALEX: Yeah, it is. I'm a big coffee fan.

BECKY: Me too.

Becky and Alex talk about coffee for a while. They also talk about their jobs, their hobbies, and their families. They quickly realize that they have a lot in common.

BECKY: I had a really great time talking to you, Alex.

ALEX: Me too, Becky.

BECKY: Well, I should probably get going. I have to meet up with some friends.

ALEX: Oh, okay.

BECKY: But maybe we can do this again sometime?

ALEX: I'd like that.

BECKY: Great. Here's my number.

Becky writes her number down on a piece of paper and hands it to Alex.

BECKY: I'll talk to you soon.

Becky smiles at Alex and then walks away. Alex watches her go. He can't stop smiling. He knows that he has just met the woman of his dreams.
