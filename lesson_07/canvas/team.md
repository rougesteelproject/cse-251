# Lesson 7 Team Teach: Using apply_async()

### Overview

We will be learning about using the pool function apply_async().

### Assignment

You will be using the process pool apply_async() function to change your lesson 2 prove assignment.

### Requirements

1. Make a copy of your lesson 2 prove assignment. Since you are working in a team this time, you can decide which lesson 2 prove assignment code that you will use for the team activity.
2. Convert the program to use a process pool and use `apply_async()` with a callback function to retrieve data from the Star Wars website. Each request for data must be a apply_async() call.
3. You can continue to use the `Request_Thread()` class from the lesson 2 prove assignment that makes the call to the server.

### Sample Solution

We will go over the solution in the last class of this week.

### Submission

When complete, please report your progress in the associated Canvas quiz. If you decided to do additional work on the program after your team activity, either by yourself or with others, feel free to include that additional work when you report on your progress in Canvas.
