Course: CSE 251 
Lesson: L07 Team
File:   team.py
Author: <Add name here>

Purpose: Retrieve Star Wars details from a server.

Instructions:

1) Make a copy of your lesson 2 prove assignment. Since you are  working in a team for this
   assignment, you can decide which assignment 2 program that you will use for the team activity.

2) You can continue to use the Request_Thread() class that makes the call to the server.

3) Convert the program to use a process pool that uses apply_async() with callback function(s) to
   retrieve data from the Star Wars website. Each request for data must be a apply_async() call;
   this means 1 url = 1 apply_async call, 94 urls = 94 apply_async calls.
